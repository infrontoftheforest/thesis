# Idea of Preconditioning - Skimmed
Speed depends on spectral properties of A. Construct a cheap and easy to invert approximation W of A, s.t. AW^-1 ~= I, (i.e. EW close to 1). Solve AW^(-1)*(Wx) = b. This right preconditioning preserves rhs b, and the residual norm. Literature Saad [171] and Benzi [21]. Many competing methods, maybe I should compare them to multigrid and schur preconditioning.

# Basics of Multigrid Methods - Read
Definition of a relaxation based method: defines iteration (x^(k+1) := M*x^(k) - Q^-1*b) and iteration matrix (M:= I - Q^-1*A). Richardson, Jacobi, Gauss-Seidl definitions. Gauss-Seidl convergers fro positive definite matricies monotonally w.r.t. to the energy norm. General overview: Axelsson [6], Hackbusch [86].

Weak diag dominance important for convergence of relaxation-based methods. FEM generates matrices that are weakly diagonally dominant. Gershgorin

Different behavior for the high and low freq error modes. Geometric Multigrid - transfer to coarser mesh to smooth. AMG - define coarse representation purely algebraically. Aggregation-based AMG: Agglomerate nodes into aggregates with a transfer operator.

# Aggregation-based AMG methods

The point: GMG: complex geometries and unstructured meshes: how to generate coarse?
AMG: using information from A to determine mesh connectivity and build coarse level, then construct interp/restrict ops to transfer. Design of ops comes with complexities such as rigid body modes. In aggregation, Near null space modes are automatically considered during construction of the transfer operators per design.

Setup needs fine level nullspace B approximation. Defining a tentative prolongation op indirectly defines B_{l+1}. Tentative Prolongators are then smoothed. R = P^T can be used, but more sophisticated is available.

Requirements for prolongators are defined in [124] and [192, 197]...

Can have a mapping between dof's of A and nodes. Graph G(A), Neighborhood Nb, set of connected nodes where g_{ij} = 1. Node geometrically defined on fine level. On coarser level, the aggregates are nodes, and their DoF's are the coefficients of the basis functions.

Matrix Filtering
Useful for inherent anisotropy. Use the graph of a filted operator A instead. Threshold for the off-diag. Modify the diag by something? (Why?). Overall, filtering meets the O1 requirement: Support of coarse basis functions follow strong coupling because two DoFs are strongly coupled if abs(a_{ij}) is relatively large compared to sqrt(abs(a_{ii}*a_{jj})). Neighboring nodes are strongly coupled in the direction of anisotropy. (similar to normal AMG, find some sources to describe, maybe make an example with GMG and AMG. Could have intro to anisotropy in prev sections and then later mention exact matrix filtering later which SAAMG uses.).

Aggregation algorithm:
Node agglomerates form a disjoint covering of the set of all nodes on current level. Tentative -> Enlarge -> Leftovers.
