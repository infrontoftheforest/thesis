Numerical simulations now form an important pillar of the scientific and engineering disciplines, and with advances in both parallel computing and numerical methods, the sizes of systems arising from the discretization of mathematical models are ever-growing. Many important methods produce sparse and ill-conditioned systems, which require specialized treatment by numerical methods and their implementations. Multigrid methods can handle the efficient solution of such systems if the underlying theory is understood so that they are well-designed. This thesis focuses primarily on the use of the smoothed aggregation multigrid method as a preconditioner within Krylov subspace solvers. The libraries AztecOO and MueLu from the Trilinos project are used to study the behavior of the methods as they apply to practical problems. The use of these iterative methods is not straight-forward without understanding the underlying theory, and they are by no means so-called “black-box” solvers. Numerical experiments are done to determine parameters required in order to obtain desired scalability in parallel, as well as performance for ill-conditioned systems, especially when compared to sparse direct solvers.
